## Executive Summary

Unfortunately, active transportation percentages in Canada are very low. Driving has the advantage of direct transportation from home to destination, but often the disadvantage of traffic congestion and the costs of operating a vehicle and parking. Transit, including light rail, subways, and bus rapid transit are often undeterred by traffic congestion. However, there are often multiple legs to a trip (e.g., walking to a bus stop, waiting for a bus, travelling to a station, which can make transit use a longer trip than driving). By investigating the potential of cycling to transit stations to replace the local bus portion of trips, we may see that this can reduce some of the time taken by some of the legs of the trip in cases where individuals can walk to the station, or cycle to it from a few kilometers away, and increase physical activity levels. 

The purpose of this analysis was to compare travel distance and physical activity amounts attained from point-to-point travel by automobile, public transit only, bicycle only, and bicycle to public transit to downtown areas. 

## Methods

Six cities were chosen (Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Calgary). Two stations were selected for each city. Each station was selected based on distance from the city center and proximity to a transit station. T The downtown destinations selected were either art galleries or libraries as public spaces in each city. Twenty five randomly selected street addresses within a 5km buffer of these two stations to the downtown central business districts. All of the code and a detailed read me file are available for the analysis [https://github.com/walkabilly/phac_routing](https://github.com/walkabilly/phac_routing). 

## Results

On average across all modes the trip duration was 48 minutes with a mean distance of 22.2km. On average car trips were the fastest at 30 minutes on average and a mean distance of 22.1km. The next fastest trip mode was biking to transit with an average time of 36 minutes and distance of 25.3km. Transit and cycling the entire distance had similar times with average travel times of 72 minutes. 

## Discussion

This analysis examined trips across 6 large Canadian cities and the results suggest that cycling to transit is an excellent means to include more physical activity into the day. On average, cycling to transit adds on average 6minutes (30minutes by driving compared to 36minutes cycling and using transit) to the time of a commute compared to other modes, including driving. In many cases, cycling to transit is very time competitive to driving and is usually the second fastest form of travel, usually faster than transit only trips.



# Introduction

Active transportation (AT) is one of the four domains of physical activity and is associated with higher levels of total physical activity. Consequently, it is an important behaviour to target for health promotion and chronic disease prevention. AT is particularly attractive as a target for physical activity promotion, given that individuals generally travel to various destinations throughout the day. By replacing sedentary forms of transportation (such as motor vehicle use) with active forms of transportation (such as cycling or walking), Canadians can increase their physical activity levels. Moreover, walking and especially cycling for transportation are often carried out at intensitieis of physical activity (i.e., moderate-to-vigourous intensity) that contribute towards meeting the physical activity recommendation from the the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines.

Typically, people opt for active modes of transportation for travelling shorter distances (i.e. to and from a local shop or public transit stop). Using origin-destination survey data in Montreal, it was found that the 85th percentile of trip distance for walking to various destinations was under 2 kilometers, and for cycling it was less than 6.5 kilometers (Yasmin, F. et. al., 2010, Larsen J, 2010). This is an important consideration for the promotion of AT. Although within smaller cities, large portions of the population live within these distances of frequently visited destinations, in larger cities, there are often substantial numbers of residents living much further from these destinations in the central business district (CBD). Promoting AT to cover large distances is unlikely to be successful if the messaging suggests that they should walk or bike the entire trip. However, many recent investments in Canada have been made to expand mass rapid transit (MRT) systems (including subways, light rail and bus rapid transit). This expansion has brought higher speed transit and stations closer to suburban neighbourhoods and is often faster than the stop and start nature of typical bus routes.

In many countries with more mature MRT systems, it is common to see bikes parked at transit stations with commuters continuing their journey by bus or rail. Theoretically, such transportation choices are becoming increasingly available to more Canadians as new commuter rail, subway, Light Rapid Transit, and Bus Rapid Transit become available in large Canadian cities. Although some of the supporting infrastructure of secure bike parking and easy walking and cycling sidewalks and bikeways are not yet available, those infrastructure expenses are a fraction of the cost of the MRT projects themselves. A key question to consider before developing policy aimed at getting people to use more AT, is how do trips incorporating AT to MRT compare to those completed entirely by car and/or entirely by transit? To determine this, it is important to understand how the duration of trips to MRT by walking or cycling compare to trips taken entirely by transit or entirely by driving.

Driving has the advantage of direct transportation from home to destination, but often the disadvantage of traffic congestion and the costs of operating a vehicle and parking. While MRT is often undeterred by traffic congestion, there are often multiple legs to a trip, e.g. walking to a bus stop, waiting for a bus, travelling to a MRT station, which can make transit use a longer trip than driving. However, by investigating the potentional of taking AT to the MRT to replace the local bus portion of trips, we may see that this can reduce some of the time taken by some of the legs of the trip in cases where individuals can walk to the station, or cycle to it from a few kilometers away, and increase physical activity levels. 

## Objective

To compare travel distance and physical activity amounts attained from point-to-point travel by automobile to CBD station, bus to MRT to CBD station, and by AT to MRT to CBD station.

## Methods

All of the code and a detailed read me file are available for the analysis [https://github.com/walkabilly/phac_routing](https://github.com/walkabilly/phac_routing). Sufficient detail is provided the replicate the analysis. This work used the [Google Route API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/routes/) implemented in the [googleway R package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/googleway/versions/2.7.8) to to compare travel time, travel distance, and estimated physical activity contribution of trips from 25 randomly selected street addresses within a 5km buffer of these two stations to the downtown central business districts (CBD) of 6 major Canadian cities. The modes of transportation used for the trip calculations were

* Transit Only
    * Time and distance calculations include walking to and from stations
* Bike 
* Bike + Transit 
    * Bike to main station and transit to destination
* Drive 

### Origin  - Station Selection 

Each station was selected based on distance from the city center, proximity to a transit station, and discussion with staff at PHAC. This was not an exact science but meant to represent a selection of 2 stations per city to a sense of travel times and distances for different modes of transportation. The selected stations are as follows

1. Ottawa
    * Blair Station
    * Barrhaven
2. Montreal 
    * Brossard Station
    * Rivière-des-Prairies Station
3. Toronto
    * Vaughan Metropolitan Centre Stations
    * Scarborough GO Station
4. Vancouver
    * Surrey Central Station
    * Bridgeport Station
5. Edmonton
    * Heritage Valley Station
    * Nakî Transit Centre & Park and Ride
6. Calgary
    * North Pointe Transit Terminal
    * McKenzie Towne

### Destination - City center 

Destinations were selected for each city. Each destination was either a major Art Gallery or Library located in the city of each city. These locations were selected because they are public, are located downtown, and draw considerable numbers of people. The destination locations are as follows

1. Ottawa
    * National Gallery of Canada
2. Montreal 
    * Musee d'art contemporain de Montreal
3. Toronto
    * Art Gallery of Ontario
4. Vancouver
    * Vancouver Art Gallery
5. Edmonton
    * Edmonton Public Library - Stanley A. Milner Library
6. Calgary
    * Calgary Public Library - Central Library

### Buffer and Home Selection

For each origin at a station, a 5km diameter buffer is drawn around the station. Within that 5km buffer, 25 points (ie., lat lon coordinates) are randomly selected using a seed to ensure reproducibility. A different seed is used for each station. Below is an example of the buffer and 25 points selected for the Ottawa Barrhaven Station.

##### Figure 1. 5km buffer around Barrhaven Station in Ottawa.   

![](barrhaven_buffer.png)


##### Figure 2. Randomly selected points within the 5km buffer around Barrhaven station.  

![](buffer_points.png)

For each trip type (i.e., Transit Only, Bike, Bike + Transit, and Drive) the `googleway` R package is used to generate trips from the randomly generated points to the destination. All trips are scheduled to arrive at the destination at 8:30am on either Tuesday June 11th or Tuesday June 25th. For the Bike + Transit trips, two trips are generated. First, a trip from the randomly selected point to the station of interest by bicycle, then a trip from the station of interest to the destination by transit.

Once all of the routes were calculated the travel time and travel distance elements were extracted from each trip type and each route and organized into a tidy dataset. On average there were 25 routes per trip type, however, on some occasions some routes failed to geocode. Table 1 presents the city, station, and trip type sample sizes for all cities.

# Analysis

Descriptive analysis will be conducted to describe the trip time and distance for all stations and cities together, then separately for individual cities. No statistical tests will be performed. 

##### Table 2. Descriptive statisics for travel time and mode by trip type by station

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
rm_covsum(data=data, maincov = 'station', pvalue = FALSE,
covs=c('distance_km','duration_hours'))
```

Across of the stations the longest travel time on average was Surrey Central Station with an average travel time of 66 minutes. McKenzie Town in Calgary and Riviere-des-Prairies in Montreal also had average travel times of 60 minutes. The shortest average travel times were Blair Station in Ottawa and Brossard Station in Montreal with average travel times being 36 minutes. It should be noted that the stations we selected were chosen to be relatively far from the downtown, with an average of distance of 22.2km and a range of 5.3km to 46.4km. 

##### Table 3. Descriptive statisics for travel time and mode by trip type

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
rm_covsum(data=data, maincov = 'mode', pvalue = FALSE,
covs=c('distance_km','duration_hours'))
```

On average across all modes the trip duration was 48 minutes with a mean distance of 22.2km. On average car trips were the fastest at 30 minutes on average and a mean distance of 22.1km. The next fastest trip mode was biking to transit with an average time of 36 minutes and distance of 25.3km. Transit and cycling the entire distance had similar times with average travel times of 72 minutes. 

##### Figure 4. Visualization of travel time by mode and city

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
viz <- ggplot(data, aes(x = duration_hours, y = mode, fill = mode)) +
  geom_density_ridges() + 
  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, alpha = 0.75, quantiles = 2) +
  labs(
  x = "Duration in Hours",
  y = "Travel Mode",
  fill = "Travel Mode") +
  facet_wrap(~ station_name)
plot(viz)
```

The `joy plot` shows a histogram for travel time for each travel mode and each station. In general, the car travel mode has the shortest travel time and the most narrow range of the distribution. This suggests that driving is the fastest travel mode and the most consistent in terms of time. The next fastest travel mode was bike + transit, which was generally similar in travel time to driving except for the McKenzie Towne (Calgary), Blair (Ottawa), and Naki Transit Center (Calgary) stations. The distribution of the bike + transit travel times was wider for bike + transit compared to driving. Taking transit was rarely competitive with driving or biking + transit. The closest transit time between bike, bike + transit, and car was Surrey Central station. For transit use, the distribution was very wide, particularly for McKenzie Towne and Heritage Valley. Finally, simply cycling the entire distance was often time competitive with public transit and half of the time of driving. 

While this analysis did not consider whether key AT supporting infrastructure, it does suggest that if this infrastructure is built, a combination of cycling and transit can be very competitive with driving for suburban trips. Such investments could support higher levels of physical activity, lower greenhouse gas emissions and road congestion, and higher transit ridership.


## Limitations

There are a number of limitations to this work. The limitations mostly relate to the default settings in the Google Routing API, the random selection of points, and the time of day chosen for the analysis. 

1. This analysis did not consider whether key AT supporting infrastructure or policy exists on these for the cycling trips. In many of the areas around the origin stations, cycling infrastructure is likely lacking. Improving cycling infrastructure around transit stations could support more cycling to transit, as many cyclists may not cycle in areas with poor infrastructure. 
2. The transit routing uses the default settings in the Google Maps API for each of the modes. The transit options include potential alternate routing preferences including `less_walking` and `fewer_transfers`. We did not test each of the different transit routing options as sensitivity analyses. 
3. The bicycle routing analysis includes the default Google bikeway analysis. The Google Routes API clearly states that `bicycling routes are in beta and might sometimes be missing clear sidewalks, pedestrian paths, or bicycling paths`. If there were paths that were more direct from residential areas to transit, this would make the bike trip shorter, and we are assuming that we are routing the bikes along roadways only. The bike to transit and transit trips may be slowed a bit because we are routing all those trips to a certain station, but in fact there may be a closer station to downtown that we are not accounting for. In those cases, we are modelling commuters back-tracking to the station of interest. 
4. Related to point number 2, because the 25 points within the 5km buffer around the station were randomly generated, it sometimes happens that points are located in areas were a route is not able to be created (e.g., on water). This means that not all stations have 25 points. However, for a given station, the seed (i.e., where the points are generated) is the same, which means that all travel modes have the same number of points for a given station. 
5. For the purpose of this work, we set the arrival time to Tuesday mornings at 8:30am (either on June 11 or June 18, 2024). Travel times vary over the morning and afternoon peak periods and we did not model trips across a variety of travel times. 

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, overall cycling plus using transit to get from suburban areas appears to be competitive with driving and is faster than taking transit only or cycling the entire distance. The time difference across all cities was approximately 6 minutes slow for cycling to transit compared to driving, however, the distribution was wider for cycling to transit compared to driving.
