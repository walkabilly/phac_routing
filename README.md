# Combining Mass Rapid Transit and Active Transportation for Physical Activity Promotion

## Objectives 

To compare travel distance and physical activity amounts attained from point-to-point travel by automobile to CBD station, bus to MRT to CBD station, and by AT to MRT to CBD station.

##  Scope of work

Using online tools such as Google maps travel planning or R5 (Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks), this project will compare two MRT stations on the fringes of 6 major Canadian Cities: 

1. Ottawa
    * Blair Station
    * Barrhaven
2. Montreal 
    * Brossard Station
    * Rivière-des-Prairies Station
3. Toronto
    * Vaughan Metropolitan Centre Stations
    * Scarborough GO Station
4. Vancouver
    * Surrey Central Station
    * Bridgeport Station
5. Edmonton
    * Heritage Valley Station
    * Nakî Transit Centre & Park and Ride
6. Calgary
    * North Pointe Transit Terminal
    * McKenzie Towne


Routing tools will be used to compare travel time, travel distance, and estimated physical activity contribution of trips from 25 randomly selected street addresses within a 5km buffer of these two stations to the downtown central business districts (CBD). For each trip, the driving distance from the home street address to the CBD will be compared to a trip that is completed fully using public transit, and one that involves walking (if the MRT is less than 1km from the home) or biking (if the MRT is greater than 1km from the home but less than 5km) from the home. Below we provide an example with one street address (189 Portrush Ave, Ottawa, ON K2J 5K1) for the Fallowfield station BRT station in Ottawa to Downtown Ottawa.
